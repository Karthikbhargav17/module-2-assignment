			A database is simply an organized collection of related data, typically stored on disk, and accessible by possibly many concurrent users. Databases are generally separated into application areas. For example, one database may contain Human Resource (employee and payroll) data; another may contain sales data; another may contain accounting data; and so on. Databases are managed by a DBMS.

			SQL, which is an abbreviation for Structured Query Language, is a language to request data from a database, to add, update, or remove data within a database, or to manipulate the metadata of the database.SQL is a declarative language in which the expected result or operation is given without the specific details about how to accomplish the task. The steps required to execute SQL statements are handled transparently by the SQL database. Sometimes SQL is characterized as non-procedural because procedural languages generally require the details of the operations to be specified, such as opening and closing tables, loading and searching indexes, or flushing buffers and writing data to filesystems. Therefore, SQL is considered to be designed at a higher conceptual level of operation than procedural languages because the lower level logical and physical operations aren't specified and are determined by the SQL engine or server process that executes it.
